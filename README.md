# Brooke's Dotfiles

Herin lie the dotfiles of Brooke. To install, clone this repo and run `make`
from its root. This will create symlinks between the contents of this repo
and their default locations in your home directory. If any of these files
(.vimrc) or directories (.vim) already exist, you can delete them with
`make clean` before running `make` to create the symlinks.
